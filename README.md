# **Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Balanced Pre-training for Generative Adversarial Networks**

In this project, my capstone research project group proposes a novel method called "[*Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Balanced Pre-training for Generative Adversarial Networks (CAPGAN)*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10032367)" as an augmentation tool to generate realistic synthetic images in the presence of highly imbalanced imaging datasets.
